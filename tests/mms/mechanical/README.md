# Verification of the mechanical solver with MMS

This directory has two subdirectories with scripts to perform verification using the Method of Manufactured solutions of the mechanical solver in [FeenoX](https://www.seamplex.com/feenox).

 * [Small deformations](sdef)
 * [Large deformations](ldef)

> [!HINT]
> The [thermal cases](../mechanical) exaplain the basis of the MMS method with more details.

> [!NOTE]
> Check out this video for an explanation about MMS: <https://youtu.be/mGNwL8TGijg>
