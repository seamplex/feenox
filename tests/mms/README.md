# Verification with the Method of Manufactured Solution

Check out this video for an explanation about MMS: <https://youtu.be/mGNwL8TGijg>

Verification of problems in FeenoX:

 * [Heat conduction `thermal`](thermal)
   - [2D](thermal/2d)
   - [3D](thermal/3d)
 * [Elasticity `mechanical`](mecahnical)
   - [3D small deformation](mechanical/sdef)
   - [3D large deformation](mechanical/ldef)
