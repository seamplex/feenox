# can we give the three properties underscore the name of the volume
E_top = 200e9
nu_top = 0
alpha_top = 1e-5

E_bottom = 200e9
nu_bottom = 0
alpha_bottom = 2e-5

# or using the MATERIAL keyword, but then in the analytical solution
# we have to give the right value of x,y,z to choose between the two
# MATERIAL top    E=200e9 nu=0 alpha=1e-5
# MATERIAL bottom E=200e9 nu=0 alpha=2e-5

# since E and nu are the same we could have given them as variables
# E = 200e9
# nu = 0
