  ## Mechanical problem
 
  Now this input file reads the scalar function `T` stored in the coarse first-order mesh file
  `parallelepiped-temperature.msh` and uses it to solve the mechanical problem in the finer
  second-order mesh `parallelepiped.msh`.
  The numerical solution for the displacements over the fine mesh is written in a VTK file
  (along with the temperature as interpolated from the coarse mesh) and compared
  to the analytical solution using theÂ $L_2$ norm.
