  # Thermal slabs
  
  ## One-dimensional linear
 
 
  Solve heat conduction on the slab $x \in [0:1]$ with boundary conditions
 
  $$
  \begin{cases}
  T(0) = 0 & \text{(left)} \\
  T(1) = 1 & \text{(right)} \\
  \end{cases}
  $$
 
  and uniform conductivity. Compute $T\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)$.
  
  
  Please note that:
 
   * The input written in a self-evident English-like dialect
      - Syntactic sugared plain-text ASCII file
      - Simple problems (like this one) need simple inputs
      - FeenoX follows the Unix rule of simplicity
     
   * Output is 100% user-defined
      - No `PRINT` no output
      - Feenox follows the Unix rule of silence
    
   * There is no node at $x=1/2=0.5$!
      - FeenoX knows how to interpolate
 
   * Mesh separated from problem
      - The geometry comes from a Git-friendly `.geo`
 
      ```{.c include="slab.geo"}
      ```
      - Unix rule of composition
      - The actual input file is a Git-friendly `.fee`
