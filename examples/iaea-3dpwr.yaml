  # IAEA 3D PWR Benchmark
  
  The IAEA 3D PWR Benchmark is a classical problem for core-level diffusion codes.
  The original geometry, cross sections and boundary conditions are shown in [@fig:iaea-3dpwr-fig1;@fig:iaea-3dpwr-fig2;@fig:iaea-3dpwr-fig3].

  The FeenoX approach consists of modeling both the original one-quarter-symmetric geometry _and_ the more reasonable one-eighth-symmetry geometry in a 3D CAD cloud tool such as Onshape ([@fig:iaea-3dpwr-quarter-onshape;@fig:iaea-3dpwr-eighth-onshape]). Then, the CAD is imported and meshed in Gmsh to obtain a second-order unstructured tetrahedral grids suitable to be used by FeenoX to solve the multi-group neutron diffusion equation ([@fig:iaea-3d-quarter-mesh;@fig:iaea-3d-eighth-mesh])

  Unstructured second-order tetrahedral grid for the eighth case
  :::

  The terminal mimic shows that the eighth case can be solved faster and needs less memory than the original quarter-symmetry case. Recall that the original problem does have 1/8th symmetry but since historically all core-level solvers can only handle structured hexahedral grids, nobody ever took advantage of it.
