  # NAFEMS LE10 “Thick plate pressure” benchmark
 
  ![The NAFEMS LE10 problem statement and the corresponding FeenoX input](nafems-le10-problem-input.svg){width=100%}
 
  Assuming the CAD has already been created in [STEP format](nafems-le10.step)
  (for instance using Gmsh with [this geo file](https://github.com/seamplex/feenox/blob/main/examples/nafems-le10-cad.geo)),
  create a tetrahedral locally-refined unstructured grid with
  Gmsh using the following `.geo` file:
 
  ```{.c include="nafems-le10.geo"}
  ```
 
  and then use this pretty-straightforward input file that has a one-to-one correspondence
  with the original problem formulation from 1990:
terminal: |
  $ gmsh -3 nafems-le10.geo
  [...]
  $ feenox nafems-le10.fee
  sigma_y @ D = -5.37968 MPa
  $
