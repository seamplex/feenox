  # Financial decisions under inflation
  
  You live in a country with a high inflation rate.
  A retailer offers you a good with two payment options:

   a. 30% off the full price plus 3 equal monthly installments, or
   b. full price in 12 equal monthly installments
   
  If the inflation rate is small (large), option a (b) wins.
  
  **Question** What is the monthly inflation rate at which the two options are equally good (or bad)?

  the tipping monthly inflation is 0.0931703 (that means 9.3% per month and 291.2% per year)
  
  with 12 payments no discount with r = 0.10317 you pay 0.617
  with  3 payments and 30% off with r = 0.10317 you pay 0.637
  
  with 12 payments no discount with r = 0.0831703 you pay 0.669
  with  3 payments and 30% off with r = 0.0831703 you pay 0.648
