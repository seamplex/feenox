  # Thermo-elastic expansion of finite cylinders
 
  Let us solve the following problem introduced by J.\ Veeder in his [technical report AECL-2660 from 1967](https://inis.iaea.org/search/search.aspx?orig_q=RN:40103718).

  The problem is axisymmetric on the azimutal angle and axially-symmetric along the mid-plane.
  The FeenoX input uses the `tangential` and `radial` boundary conditions applied to the base of
  the upper half of a 3D cylinder. The geometry is meshed using 27-noded hexahedra.
 
  Two one-dimensional profiles for the non-dimensional range\ $[0:1]$ at the external surfaces are written into an ASCII file ready to be plotted:
 
   1. axial dependency of the displacement\ $v(z') = v(0,v,z'h)$ in the\ $y$ direction at fixed $x=0$ and $y=b$, and
   2. radial dependency of the displacement\ $w(r') = w(0,r'b, h)$ in the\ $z$ direction at fixed $x=0$ and $z=h$
  
  These two profiles are compared to the power expansion series given in the original report from 1967.
  Note that the authors expect a 5% difference between the reference solution and the real one.
