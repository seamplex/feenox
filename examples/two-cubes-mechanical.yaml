  # Two cubes compressing each other

  Say we have two cubes of non-dimensional size $1\times 1 \times 1$, one made out of a (non-dimensional) "soft" material and one made out of a "hard" material.
  We glue the two cubes together, set radial and tangential symmetry conditions on one side of the soft cube (so as to allow pure traction conditions) and set a normal compressive pressure at the other end on the hard cube. 
  Besides on single VTU file with the overall results, the von Mises stress output is split into two VTU files---namely `soft.vtu` and `hard.vtu` where the stress is non-zero only in the corresponding volume.
  
  This example illustrates how to
 
   #. assign different material properties to different volumes
   #. write VTU outputs segmented by mesh volumes
   #. write results at nodes (default) and at cells
