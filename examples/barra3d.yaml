 # Transient heat conduction from steady-state by "turning off" BCs

 This problem solves the transient over a slender cylider arising from "turning off" a heat source that provided a fixed heat flux at both ends, while the cylindrical surface is subject to convection conditions.

 The transient goes from $t=0~\text{s}$ up to end time $t=1000~\text{s}$.
 We force the time stepper to pass exactly through the following timesÂ $t$
 
  * 1
  * 10
  * 100
  * `end_time`/2
  
 At these times, the special variable `in_time_path` is true.
 We use an `IF` condition to write the profile along the $x$ axis on
 
  1. a single file named `profiles.dat` with an extra column for the time $t$
  2. one file for each time step `profile-t.dat`
  
 for the selected times (or during the static step at $t=0$ and the final step at $t=1000$).
