  # Buffon’s needle
  
  Buffon's needle is a classical probability problem that dates back from the 18th century whose solution depends on the value of $\pi$. When I first read about this problem in my high-school years, I could not believe two things. The first one, that the number $\pi$ had something to do with the probability a stick has of crossing a line. And the other, that one would actually be able to compute $\pi$ by throwing away sticks. Of course, this was long before I learned about calculus, distributions and Monte Carlo methods. 

  The problem consists of a table of length $L$ over which transversal lines separated by a length $d$ are drawn. A stick (needle) of length $\ell$ is randomly thrown over the table. What is the probability $p$ that the stick crosses one line?

  For $\ell < d$ the answer is

  $$
  p = \frac{ 2 \ell }{ \pi d}
  $$

  To convince myself that the two facts I did not believe back when I was a youngster were actually true, I would just run the example below. Four experiments (I know that generating random numbers in a digital computer is not a real experiment, as neither is solving the equations of a chaotic natural convection loop. However, I could not come up with a better word) of ten millions throws each are simulated, and the experimental frequency is compared to the theoretical value. I am now convinced.
  
  To solve the Buffon's needle problem the Monte Carlo way, two random numbers are generated: the distance $0 \leq x < L$  from one side of the table to the center of the thrown stick, and the angle $0 \leq \theta < 2\pi$ with respect to the table longitudinal axis. One way of checking  whether a stick crosses or not a line is the following. First, compute the location of both ends of the stick

  \begin{align*}
  x_1 &= x + \frac{1}{2} \ell \cos(\theta)  \\
  x_2 &= x - \frac{1}{2} \ell \cos(\theta)  \\
  \end{align*}


  Now, if the floor of $x_1/d$ is equal to the floor of $x_2/d$, the stick does not cross a line. Otherwise, it does. 

  The input file iteratively performs $10^7$ throws and prints the partial frequency of crosses as a function of the number of throws, along with the constant analytical result. Four runs are performed, and the results are plotted in the figure.
