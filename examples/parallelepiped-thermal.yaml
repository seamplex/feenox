  # Parallelepiped whose Young’s modulus is a function of the temperature
 
  The problem consists of finding the non-dimensional temperature\ $T$ and displacements\ $u$, $v$
  and $w$ distributions within a solid parallelepiped of length\ $l$ whose base is a square of $h\times h$.
  The solid is subject to heat fluxes and to a traction pressure at the same time.
  The non-dimensional Young’s modulus\ $E$ of the material depends on the temperature\ $T$
  in a know algebraically way, whilst both the Poisson coefficient\ $\nu$ and the thermal conductivity\ $k$
  are uniform and do not depend on the spatial coordinates:
 
  $$
  \begin{aligned}
  E(T) &= \frac{1000}{800-T} \\
  \nu &= 0.3 \\
  k &= 1 \\
  \end{aligned}
  $$

  This thermo-mechanical problem is solved in two stages. First, the heat conduction
  equation is solved over a coarse first-order mesh to find the non-dimensional temperature distribution.
  Then, a mechanical problem is solved where $T(x,y,z)$ is read from the first mesh
  and interpolated into a finer second-order mesh so to as evaluate the non-dimensional Young's modulus
  as
 
  $$E\Big(T(x,y,z)\Big) = \frac{1000}{800-T(x,y,z)}$$
 
  Note that there are not thermal expansion effects (i.e. the thermal expansion coefficient is $\alpha=0$).
  Yet, suprinsingly enough, the problem has analytical solutions for both the temperature and the displacement fields.
 
  ## Thermal problem
 
  The following input solves the thermal problem over a coarse first-order mesh, writes the resulting
  temperature distribution into `parallelepiped-temperature.msh`, and prints the $L_2$ error of the numerical
  result with respect to the analytical solution $T(x,y,z) = 40 - 2x - 3y - 4z$.
