  # On the evaluation of thermal expansion coefficients
 
  When solving thermal-mechanical problems it is customary to use
  thermal expansion coefficients in order to take into account the mechanical
  strains induced by changes in the material temperature with respect to
  a reference temperature where the deformation is identically zero.
  These coefficients $\alpha$ are defined as the partial derivative
  of the strain $\epsilon$ with respect to temperature $T$ such that
  differential relationships like
 
  $$
  d\epsilon = \frac{\partial \epsilon}{\partial T} \, dT = \alpha \cdot dT
  $$
 
  hold. This derivative $\alpha$ is called the _instantaneous_
  thermal expansion coefficient.
  For finite temperature increments, one would like to be able to write
 
  $$
  \Delta \epsilon = \alpha \cdot \Delta T
  $$
 
  But if the strain is not linear with respect to the temperature---which
  is the most common case---then $\alpha$ depends on $T$.
  Therefore, when dealing with finite temperature increments $\Delta T = T-T_0$
  where the thermal expansion coefficient $\alpha(T)$ depends on the temperature
  itself then _mean_ values for the thermal expansion ought to be used:
 
  $$
  \Delta \epsilon = \int_{\epsilon_0}^{\epsilon} d\epsilon^{\prime} 
  = \int_{T_0}^{T} \frac{\partial \epsilon}{\partial T^\prime} \, dT^\prime
  = \int_{T_0}^{T} \alpha(T^\prime) \, dT^\prime
  $$
 
  We can multiply and divide by $\Delta T$ to obtain
 
  $$
  \int_{T_0}^{T} \alpha(T^\prime) \, dT^\prime \cdot \frac{\Delta T}{\Delta T}
  = \bar{\alpha}(T) \cdot \Delta T
  $$
  
  where the mean expansion coefficient for the temperature range $[T_0,T]$ is 
 
  $$
  \bar{\alpha}(T) = \frac{\displaystyle \int_{T_0}^{T} \alpha(T^\prime) \, dT^\prime}{T-T_0}
  $$
  
  This is of course the classical calculus result of the mean value of a
  continuous one-dimensional function in a certain range.
 
  Let $\epsilon(T)$ be the linear thermal expansion of a given material in a
  certain direction when heating a piece of such material from an initial
  temperature $T_0$ up to $T$ so that $\epsilon(T_0)=0$.
  
  ![Table TE2 of thermal expansion properties for Aluminum alloys from ASME II Part D (figure from [this report](https://www.ramsay-maunder.co.uk/knowledge-base/technical-notes/asmeansys-potential-issue-with-thermal-expansion-calculations/).](asme-expansion-table.png){#fig:table-asme-expansion}
 
  From our previous analysis, we can see that in @fig:table-asme-expansion:
  
  $$
  \begin{aligned}
  A(T) &= \alpha(T)       = \frac{\partial \epsilon}{\partial T} \\
  B(T) &= \bar{\alpha}(T) = \frac{\epsilon(T)}{T-T_0} = \frac{\displaystyle \int_{T_0}^{T} \alpha(T^\prime) \, dT^\prime}{T - T_0} \\
  C(T) &= \epsilon(T)     = \int_{T_0}^T \alpha(T^\prime) \, dT^\prime
  \end{aligned}
  $$
  
  Therefore,
 
   i.   $A(T)$ can be computed out of $C(T)$
   ii.  $B(T)$ can be computed either out of $A(T)$ or $C(T)$
   iii. $C(T)$ can be computed out of $A(T)$
