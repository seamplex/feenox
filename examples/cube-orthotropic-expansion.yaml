  # Orthotropic free expansion of a cube
 
  To illustrate the point of the previous discussion, let us solve the thermal
  expansion of an unrestrained unitary cube $[0,1~\text{mm}]\times[0,1~\text{mm}]\times[0,1~\text{mm}]$
  subject to a linear radially-symmetric temperature field
  $$
  T(x,y,z) = 30 \text{ºC} + 150 \frac{\text{ºC}}{\text{mm}} \sqrt{x^2+y^2+z^2}
  $$
 
  with a mean thermal expansion coefficient for each of the three directions $x$, $y$ and $z$
  computed from each of the three columns of the ASME table TE-2, respectively.
  If the data was consistent, the displacement at any point with the same
  coordinates $x=y=z$ would be exactly equal.
