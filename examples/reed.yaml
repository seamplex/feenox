   * [William H. Reed, New Difference Schemes for the Neutron Transport Equation, Nuclear Science and Engineering, 46:2, 309-314 (1971). DOI: 10.13182/NSE46-309](http://dx.doi.org/10.13182/NSE46-309)
  
  is a common test problem for transport codes.
  It is comprised of heterogeneous materials with  strong absorber, vacuum, and scattering regions.
  These regions are valuable to testing different aspects of numerical discretizations.
