  # Non-dimensional transient heat conduction with time-dependent properties

  Say we have two cubes of non-dimensional size $1\times 1 \times 1$, one made with a material with unitary properties and the other one whose properties depend explicitly on time. We glue the two cubes together, fix one side of the unitary material to a fixed zero temperature and set a ramp of temperature between zero and one at the opposite end of the material with time-varying properties.
  
  This example illustrates how to
 
   #. assign different material properties to different volumes
   #. give time-dependent material properties and boundary conditions
   #. plot temperatures as function of time at arbitrary locations on space
