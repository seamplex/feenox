phi_0(x,y) = 0              # initial condition
end_time = 100              # some end time where we know we reached the steady-state
alpha = 1e-6                # factor of the time derivative to make it advance faster
BC start   phi=if(t<1,t,1)  # a ramp from zero to avoid discontinuities with the initial condition
BC end     phi=0            # homogeneous BC at the end (so we move from top to bottom)
