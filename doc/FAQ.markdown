# What is FeenoX?

It is “cloud-first a free no-fee no-X uniX-like finite-element(ish)
computational engineering tool.” Essentially, a finite-element program
with a particular design basis:

> FeenoX is to finite-element programs and libraries what Markdown is to
> word processors (like Word) and typesetting systems (like TeX),
> respectively.

In increasing order of complexity and comprehensiveness, these resources
explain what [FeenoX] is:

- The [examples] will give a brief overview of what FeenoX can do.

- The [tutorials] will walk your through how to use FeenoX to solve
  problems.

- The [README] in the [GitHub repository] has a brief introduction
  (after explaining why).

  computational engineering tool. Journal of Open Source Software,

  [![DOI]][1]

- There is also a [description] in the [documentation].

- FeenoX is an “offer” to a fictitious “tender” for a computational
  tool. The RFQ is the [Software Requirements Specification] and the
  explanation of how FeenoX addresses each requirement is the [Software
  Design Specification][Software Requirements Specification].

- This [presentation from August 2021] explains the SRS/SDS pair. The
  sources and the examples can be found in [this Github repository].
  There is a [recording of the presentation] (audio is in Spanish).

- Finally the [manual] will be the ultimate guide.

# How should I cite FeenoX?

If you use FeenoX and need to cite it, use this [BiBTeX] entry that
points to [the 2024 paper in JOSS][]:

``` bib
@article{feenox-2024,
author = {Theler, Jeremy},
doi = {10.21105/joss.05846},
journal = {Journal of Open Source Software},
month = mar,
number = {95},
pages = {5846},
title = {{FeenoX: a cloud-first finite-element(ish) computational engineering tool}},
url = {https://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.05846},
volume = {9},
year = {2024}
}
```

If you are not using BiBTeX (which you should), just use the plain-text
APA format:

# What does FeenoX mean?

It does not mean anything particular, but

- The last X makes it rhyme with Unix and Linux.
- “noX” means that there is no graphical (i.e. *X*) interface
- Fee-no means that there are no fees involved (free as in “free beer”)
- FeenoX is the successor of the now-superseded FEA program Fino
- It rhymes with FEniCS
- With some luck one can read “Finite ElEments NO-X”
- With mode luck, “FrEE” (as in “free speech”)

# How should FeenoX be pronounced?

It would be something like *fee*-*naaks*: /fiːnɒks/  
But whatever works for you is fine.

# Why nothing happens when I double click on `feenox.exe`?

Because by design, FeenoX does not have a Graphical User Interface.
Instead, it works like a transfer function between one or more input
files and zero or more output files:

                                 +------------+
     mesh (*.msh)  }             |            |             { terminal
     data (*.dat)  } input ----> |   FeenoX   |----> output { data files
     input (*.fee) }             |            |             { post (vtk/msh)
                                 +------------+

Recall that FeenoX is designed as a cloud-first tool, and “the cloud”
runs on Unix (essentially GNU/Linux) so FeenoX is based on the [Unix
philosophy]. In this world, programs act like filters (i.e. transfer
functions). They are executed from a command-line terminal. So instead
of “double clicking” the executable, one has to open a terminal and
execute it there. Without any arguments it says how to use it:

``` terminal
> feenox.exe
FeenoX v0.2.14-gbbf48c9
a free no-fee no-X uniX-like finite-element(ish) computational engineering tool

usage: feenox [options] inputfile [replacement arguments] [petsc options]

  -h, --help         display options and detailed explanations of command-line usage
  -v, --version      display brief version information and exit
  -V, --versions     display detailed version information

Run with --help for further explanations.
>
```

With `-h` it gives more information:

``` terminal
> feenox.exe -h
usage: feenox [options] inputfile [replacement arguments] [petsc options]

  -h, --help         display options and detailed explanations of command-line usage
  -v, --version      display brief version information and exit
  -V, --versions     display detailed version information

  --progress         print ASCII progress bars when solving PDEs
  --mumps            ask PETSc to use the direct linear solver MUMPS
  --linear           force FeenoX to solve the PDE problem as linear
  --non-linear       force FeenoX to solve the PDE problem as non-linear

Instructions will be read from standard input if “-” is passed as
inputfile, i.e.

    $ echo 'PRINT 2+2' | feenox -
    4

The optional [replacement arguments] part of the command line mean that
each argument after the input file that does not start with an hyphen
will be expanded verbatim in the input file in each occurrence of $1,
$2, etc. For example

    $ echo 'PRINT $1+$2' | feenox - 3 4
    7

PETSc and SLEPc options can be passed in [petsc options] as well, with
the difference that two hyphens have to be used instead of only once.
For example, to pass the PETSc option -ksp_view the actual FeenoX
invocation should be

    $ feenox input.fee --ksp_view

See https://www.seamplex.com/feenox/examples for annotated examples.

Ask questions at https://github.com/seamplex/feenox/discussions
Feenox home page: https://www.seamplex.com/feenox/
>
```

It is explained there that the main input file has to be given as the
first argument. So go to the tests or examples directory, find a test
you like and run it:

``` terminal
> cd tests
> feenox parallelepiped.fee
0.000295443
>
```

In any case, recall once again that FeenoX is a cloud-first tool, and
Windows is not cloud-friendly, let alone cloud-first. It is time to
re-think what you expect from a finite-element(ish) tool. If you still
need a GUI, please check [CAEplex].

Try to avoid Windows as much as you can. The binaries are provided as
transitional packages for people that for some reason still use such an
outdated, anachronous, awful and invasive operating system. They are
compiled with [Cygwin] and have no support whatsoever. Really, really,
**get rid of Windows ASAP**.

# How do I create input decks for FeenoX?

FeenoX does not have “input decks.” It has “input files,” which are
syntactically-sugared English-like plain-text ASCII files that describe
the problem to be solved. First see the [examples][2] and the [test
directory]. Then read the [documentation][3].

There are syntax highlighting files [for Kate] and [for Vim] that helps
the edition of input files. Contributions for other editors (emacs?) are
welcome.

# Does FeenoX support beam and/or shell elements?

No, it currently supports solid elements only. Therefore,
three-dimensional problems need to have tetrahedra, hexahedra, prisms
and/or pyramids; and two-dimensional problems need to have triangles or
quadrangles.

It might support non-solid elements for elasticity in future versions,
though. Contributions are welcome. Check out the [contributing
guidelines].

  [contributing guidelines]: https://www.seamplex.com/feenox/doc/#contributing-guidelines

# What license does FeenoX have?

TL;DR:

- The code is GPLv3+: you can use it, modify it and re-distribute it
  freely (as in free speech) as long as you keep the same licensing
  terms.
- The documentation is released under the terms of the Creative Commons
  Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License (CC BY-SA 4.0)

FeenoX is licensed under the terms of the [GNU General Public License]
version 3 or, at the user convenience, any later version. This means
that users get the four essential freedoms:[^1]

0.  The freedom to *run* the program as they wish, for *any* purpose.
1.  The freedom to *study* how the program works, and *change* it so it
    does their computing as they wish.
2.  The freedom to *redistribute* copies so they can help others.
3.  The freedom to *distribute* copies of their *modified* versions to
    others.

So a free program has to be open source, but it also has to explicitly
provide the four freedoms above both through the written license and
through appropriate mechanisms to get, modify, compile, run and document
these modifications using well-established and/or reasonable
straightforward procedures. That is why licensing FeenoX as GPLv3+ also
implies that the source code and all the scripts and makefiles needed to
compile and run it are available for anyone that requires it (i.e. it is
compiled with `./configure && make`). Anyone wanting to modify the
program either to fix bugs, improve it or add new features is free to do
so. And if they do not know how to program, the have the freedom to hire
a programmer to do it without needing to ask permission to the original
authors. Even more, [the documentation] is released under the terms of
the [Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License]
so these new (or modified) features can be properly documented as well.

Nevertheless, since these original authors are the copyright holders,
they still can use it to either enforce or prevent further actions from
the users that receive FeenoX under the GPLv3+. In particular, the
license allows re-distribution of modified versions only if

1.  they are clearly marked as different from the original, and
2.  they are distributed under the same terms of the GPLv3+.

There are also some other subtle technicalities that need not be
discussed here such as

- what constitutes a modified version (which cannot be redistributed
  under a different license)
- what is an aggregate (in which each part be distributed under
  different licenses)
- usage over a network and the possibility of using [AGPL] instead of
  GPL to further enforce freedom

These issues are already taken into account in the FeenoX licensing
scheme.

It should be noted that not only is FeenoX free and open source, but
also all of the libraries it depends on (and their dependencies) also
are. It can also be compiled using free and open source build tool
chains running over free and open source operating systems.

[^1]:  There are some examples of pieces of computational software which
    are described as “open source” in which even the first of the four
    freedoms is denied. The most iconic case is that of Android, whose
    sources are readily available online but there is no straightforward
    way of updating one’s mobile phone firmware with a customized
    version, not to mention vendor and hardware lock ins and the
    possibility of bricking devices if something unexpected happens. In
    the nuclear industry, it is the case of a Monte Carlo
    particle-transport program that requests users to sign an agreement
    about the objective of its usage before allowing its execution. The
    software itself might be open source because the source code is
    provided after signing the agreement, but it is not free (as in
    freedom) at all.

# Why is FeenoX written in C and not in…

See the [programming guide] for further discussion.

  [programming guide]: https://seamplex.com/feenox/doc/programming.html

## C++?

Let us first start with some generalities

Why is C still in use even though we have C++?  
<https://www.quora.com/Why-is-C-still-in-use-even-though-we-have-C++-Is-there-anything-that-C-can-do-but-C++-cant-or-maybe-something-that-is-easier-to-do-in-C-rather-than-C++>

As a C programmer, why didn’t you switch to C++ in your career?  
<https://qr.ae/pGzfAO>

Why is PETSc programmed in C, instead of Fortran or C++?  
C enables us to build data structures for storing sparse matrices,
solver information, etc. in ways that Fortran simply does not allow.
ANSI C is a complete standard that all modern C compilers support. The
language is identical on all machines. C++ is still evolving and
compilers on different machines are not identical. Using C function
pointers to provide data encapsulation and polymorphism allows us to get
many of the advantages of C++ without using such a large and more
complicated language. It would be natural and reasonable to have coded
PETSc in C++; we opted to use C instead.

<https://www.mcs.anl.gov/petsc/documentation/faq.html#why-c>

Why Git is written in C and not in C++, by Linus Torvalds  
C++ is a horrible language. It’s made more horrible by the fact that a
lot of substandard programmers use it, to the point where it’s much much
easier to generate total and utter crap with it. Quite frankly, even if
the choice of C were to do *nothing* but keep the C++ programmers out,
that in itself would be a huge reason to use C.

<http://harmful.cat-v.org/software/c++/linus>

In particular, I think that even though object-oriented programming does
provide a heck of a paradigm (hey, I actually rewrote my [Blackjack
engine] in C++ from its first version in C), it might subtly “force”
people to do stuff that is either way too

- convoluted
- artificial
- hard to debug
- long to compile

I nevertheless think that

- std containers are pretty cool
- templating can give and edge on some cases
- sometimes OOP may be a better approach to the Unix rule of
  representation (sometimes)

However, the pros of C++ do not outweigh its cons for a cloud-first
finite-elementish tool. Also, the name C++ is lame.

  [Blackjack engine]: https://www.seamplex.com/blackjack/

## Fortran?

Because I am not insane (yet). I do not know any sane person that would
start writing a piece of software from scratch using Fortran in the 21st
century AD.

## Python or R?

Python was not designed to perform actual computations but to add
another layer so as to ease some (and only some) tasks. The actual
computations are written in low-level languages, not in Python (nor
Octave, R, etc.) And even if it was, I would not choose a language where
scope depends on the indentation.

## Go, Rust or Julia?

I don’t know them in detail so I cannot tell if any of these languages
would be a good fit for FeenoX. Keep in mind that it took me a while to
know why not Fortran nor C++ even though there are people that would
choose them over C. Maybe something of the sort happens with these new
ideas (or not, I don’t know).
