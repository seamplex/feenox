PROBLEM mechanical           # self-descriptive
READ_MESH tensile-test.msh   # lengths are in mm

# material properties, E and nu are "special" variables for the mechanical problem
E = 200e3   # [ MPa = N / mm^2 ]
nu = 0.3

# boundary conditions, fixed and Fx are "special" keywords for the mechanical problem
# the names "left" and "right" should match the physcal names in the .geo
BC left  fixed
BC right Fx=10e6  # [ N ]

# we can now solve the problem, after this keyword the results will be available for output
