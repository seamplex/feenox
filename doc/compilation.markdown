These detailed compilation instructions are aimed at `amd64`
Debian-based GNU/Linux distributions. The compilation procedure follows
the [POSIX standard], so it should work in other operating systems and
architectures as well. Distributions not using `apt` for packages
(i.e. `yum`) should change the package installation commands (and
possibly the package names). The instructions should also work for in
MacOS, although the `apt-get` commands should be replaced by `brew` or
similar. Same for Windows under [Cygwin], the packages should be
installed through the Cygwin installer. WSL was not tested, but should
work as well.

# Quickstart

Note that the quickest way to get started is to [download] an
already-compiled statically-linked binary executable. Note that getting
a binary is the quickest and easiest way to go but it is the less
flexible one. Mind the following instructions if a binary-only option is
not suitable for your workflow and/or you do need to compile the source
code from scratch.

On a GNU/Linux box (preferably Debian-based), follow these quick steps.
See sec. 2 for the actual detailed explanations.

The Git repository has the latest sources repository. To compile,
proceed as follows. If something goes wrong and you get an error, do not
hesitate to ask in FeenoX’s [discussion page].

> If you do not have Git or Autotools, download a [source tarball] and
> proceed with the usual `configure` & `make` procedure. See [these
> instructions].

1.  Install mandatory dependencies

    ``` terminal
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install git build-essential make automake autoconf libgsl-dev
    ```

    If you cannot install `libgsl-dev` but still have `git` and the
    build toolchain, you can have the `configure` script to download and
    compile it for you. See point 4 below.

2.  Install optional dependencies (of course these are *optional* but
    recommended)

    ``` terminal
    sudo apt-get install libsundials-dev petsc-dev slepc-dev
    ```

3.  Clone Github repository

    ``` terminal
    git clone https://github.com/seamplex/feenox
    ```

4.  Bootstrap, configure, compile & make

    ``` terminal
    cd feenox
    ./autogen.sh
    ./configure
    make -j4
    ```

    If you cannot (or do not want to) use `libgsl-dev` from a package
    repository, call `configure` with `--enable-download-gsl`:

    ``` terminal
    ./configure --enable-download-gsl
    ```

    If you do not have Internet access, get the tarball manually, copy
    it to the same directory as `configure` and run again. See the
    [detailed compilation instructions] for an explanation.

5.  Run test suite (optional)

    ``` terminal
    make check
    ```

6.  Install the binary system wide (optional)

    ``` terminal
    sudo make install
    ```

    > If you do not have root permissions, configure with your home
    > directory as prefix and then make install as a regular user:
    >
    > ``` terminal
    > ./configure --prefix=$HOME
    > make
    > make install
    > ```

To stay up to date, pull and then `autogen`, `configure` and `make` (and
optionally install):

``` terminal
git pull
./autogen.sh
./configure
make -j4
sudo make install
```

# Detailed configuration and compilation

The main target and development environment is [Debian GNU/Linux],
although it should be possible to compile FeenoX in any free GNU/Linux
variant (and even the in non-free MacOS and/or Windows platforms)
running in virtually any hardware platform. FeenoX can run be run either
in HPC cloud servers or a Raspberry Pi, and almost everything that sits
in the middle.

Following the Unix philosophy discussed in the [SDS], FeenoX re-uses a
lot of already-existing high-quality free and open source libraries that
implement a wide variety of mathematical operations. This leads to a
number of dependencies that FeenoX needs in order to implement certain
features.

There is only one dependency that is mandatory, namely [GNU GSL]
(see sec. 2.1.1), which if it not found then FeenoX cannot be compiled.
All other dependencies are optional, meaning that FeenoX can be compiled
but its capabilities will be partially reduced.

As per the [SRS], all dependencies have to be available on mainstream
GNU/Linux distributions and have to be free and open source software.
But they can also be compiled from source in case the package
repositories are not available or customized compilation flags are
needed (i.e. optimization or debugging settings).

In particular, [PETSc] (and [SLEPc]) also depend on other mathematical
libraries to perform particular operations such as low-level linear
algebra operations. These extra dependencies can be either free (such as
[LAPACK]) or non-free (such as [Intel’s MKL]), but there is always at
least one combination of a working setup that involves only free and
open source software which is compatible with FeenoX licensing terms
(GPLv3+). See the documentation of each package for licensing details.

  [Intel’s MKL]: https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/tools/oneapi/onemkl.html

## Mandatory dependencies

FeenoX has one mandatory dependency for run-time execution and the
standard build toolchain for compilation. It is written in C99 so only a
C compiler is needed, although `make` is also required. Free and open
source compilers are favored. The usual C compiler is `gcc` but `clang`
or Intel’s `icc` and the newer `icx` can also be used.

Note that there is no need to have a Fortran nor a C++ compiler to build
FeenoX. They might be needed to build other dependencies (such as PETSc
and its dependencies), but not to compile FeenoX if all the dependencies
are installed from the operating system’s package repositories. In case
the build toolchain is not already installed, do so with

``` terminal
sudo apt-get install gcc make
```

If the source is to be fetched from the [Git repository] then not only
is `git` needed but also `autoconf` and `automake` since the `configure`
script is not stored in the Git repository but the `autogen.sh` script
that bootstraps the tree and creates it. So if instead of compiling a
source tarball one wants to clone from GitHub, these packages are also
mandatory:

``` terminal
sudo apt-get install git automake autoconf
```

Again, chances are that any existing GNU/Linux box has all these tools
already installed.

  [Git repository]: https://github.com/seamplex/feenox/

### The GNU Scientific Library

The only run-time dependency is [GNU GSL] (not to be confused with
[Microsoft GSL]). It can be installed with

``` terminal
sudo apt-get install libgsl-dev
```

In case this package is not available or you do not have enough
permissions to install system-wide packages, there are two options.

1.  Pass the option `--enable-download-gsl` to the `configure` script
    below.
2.  Manually download, compile and install [GNU GSL]

If the `configure` script cannot find both the headers and the actual
library, it will refuse to proceed. Note that the FeenoX binaries
already contain a static version of the GSL so it is not needed to have
it installed in order to run the statically-linked binaries.

  [GNU GSL]: https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/
  [Microsoft GSL]: https://github.com/microsoft/GSL

## Optional dependencies

FeenoX has three optional run-time dependencies. It can be compiled
without any of these, but functionality will be reduced:

- [SUNDIALS] provides support for solving systems of ordinary
  differential equations (ODEs) or differential-algebraic equations
  (DAEs). This dependency is needed when running inputs with the
  `PHASE_SPACE` keyword.

- [PETSc][1] provides support for solving partial differential equations
  (PDEs). This dependency is needed when running inputs with the
  `PROBLEM` keyword.

- [SLEPc] provides support for solving eigen-value problems in partial
  differential equations (PDEs). This dependency is needed for inputs
  with `PROBLEM` types with eigen-value formulations such as `modal` and
  `neutron_sn`.

In absence of all these, FeenoX can still be used to

- solve general mathematical problems such as the ones to compute the
  [Fibonacci sequence] or the [Logistic map],
- operate on functions, either algebraically or point-wise interpolated
  such as [Computing the derivative of a function as a Unix filter]
- read, operate over and write meshes,
- etc.

These optional dependencies have to be installed separately. There is no
option to have `configure` to download them as with
`--enable-download-gsl`. When running the test suite (sec. 2.6), those
tests that need an optional dependency which was not found at compile
time will be skipped.

### SUNDIALS

[SUNDIALS] is a SUite of Nonlinear and DIfferential/ALgebraic equation
Solvers. It is used by FeenoX to solve dynamical systems casted as DAEs
with the keyword [`PHASE_SPACE`], like [the Lorenz system].

Install either by doing

``` terminal
sudo apt-get install libsundials-dev
```

or by following the instructions in the documentation.

  [the Lorenz system]: https://www.seamplex.com/feenox/examples/#lorenz-attractor-the-one-with-the-butterfly

### PETSc

The [Portable, Extensible Toolkit for Scientific Computation],
pronounced PET-see (/ˈpɛt-siː/), is a suite of data structures and
routines for the scalable (parallel) solution of scientific applications
modeled by partial differential equations. It is used by FeenoX to solve
PDEs with the keyword [`PROBLEM`], like the [NAFEMS LE10 benchmark
problem].

Install either by doing

``` terminal
sudo apt-get install petsc-dev
```

or by following the instructions in the documentation.

Note that

- Configuring and compiling PETSc from scratch might be difficult the
  first time. It has a lot of dependencies and options. Read the
  official [documentation] for a detailed explanation.
- There is a huge difference in efficiency between using PETSc compiled
  with debugging symbols and with optimization flags. Make sure to
  configure `--with-debugging=0` for FeenoX production runs and leave
  the debugging symbols (which is the default) for development and
  debugging only.
- FeenoX needs PETSc to be configured with real double-precision
  scalars. It will compile but will complain at run-time when using
  complex and/or single or quad-precision scalars.
- FeenoX honors the `PETSC_DIR` and `PETSC_ARCH` environment variables
  when executing `configure`. If these two do not exist or are empty, it
  will try to use the default system-wide locations (i.e. the
  `petsc-dev` package).

  [documentation]: https://petsc.org/release/install/

### SLEPc

The [Scalable Library for Eigenvalue Problem Computations], is a
software library for the solution of large scale sparse eigenvalue
problems on parallel computers. It is used by FeenoX to solve PDEs with
the keyword [`PROBLEM`] that need eigen-value computations, such as
[modal analysis of a cantilevered beam].

Install either by doing

``` terminal
sudo apt-get install slepc-dev
```

or by following the instructions in the documentation.

Note that

- SLEPc is an extension of PETSc so the latter has to be already
  installed and configured.
- FeenoX honors the `SLEPC_DIR` environment variable when executing
  `configure`. If it does not exist or is empty it will try to use the
  default system-wide locations (i.e. the `slepc-dev` package).
- If PETSc was configured with `--download-slepc` then the `SLEPC_DIR`
  variable has to be set to the directory inside `PETSC_DIR` where SLEPc
  was cloned and compiled.

## FeenoX source code

There are two ways of getting FeenoX’s source code:

1.  Cloning the GitHub repository at
    <https://github.com/seamplex/feenox>
2.  Downloading a source tarball from
    <https://seamplex.com/feenox/dist/src/>

### Git repository

The main Git repository is hosted on GitHub at
<https://github.com/seamplex/feenox>. It is public so it can be cloned
either through HTTPS or SSH without needing any particular credentials.
It can also be forked freely. See the [Programming Guide] for details
about pull requests and/or write access to the main repository.

Ideally, the `main` branch should have a usable snapshot. All other
branches can contain code that might not compile or might not run or
might not be tested. If you find a commit in the main branch that does
not pass the tests, please report it in the issue tracker ASAP.

After cloning the repository

``` terminal
git clone https://github.com/seamplex/feenox
```

the `autogen.sh` script has to be called to bootstrap the working tree,
since the `configure` script is not stored in the repository but created
from `configure.ac` (which is in the repository) by `autogen.sh`.

Similarly, after updating the working tree with

``` terminal
git pull
```

it is recommended to re-run the `autogen.sh` script. It will do a
`make clean` and re-compute the version string.

  [Programming Guide]: programming.md

### Source tarballs

When downloading a source tarball, there is no need to run `autogen.sh`
since the `configure` script is already included in the tarball. This
method cannot update the working tree. For each new FeenoX release, the
whole source tarball has to be downloaded again.

## Configuration

To create a proper `Makefile` for the particular architecture,
dependencies and compilation options, the script `configure` has to be
executed. This procedure follows the [GNU Coding Standards].

``` terminal
./configure
```

Without any particular options, `configure` will check if the mandatory
[GNU Scientific Library] is available (both its headers and run-time
library). If it is not, then the option `--enable-download-gsl` can be
used. This option will try to use `wget` (which should be installed) to
download a source tarball, uncompress, configure and compile it. If
these steps are successful, this GSL will be statically linked into the
resulting FeenoX executable. If there is no internet connection, the
`configure` script will say that the download failed. In that case, get
the indicated tarball file manually, copy it into the current directory
and re-run `./configure`.

The script will also check for the availability of optional
dependencies. At the end of the execution, a summary of what was found
(or not) is printed in the standard output:

``` terminal
$ ./configure
[...]
## ----------------------- ##
## Summary of dependencies ##
## ----------------------- ##
  GNU Scientific Library  from system
  SUNDIALS IDA            yes
  PETSc                   yes /usr/lib/petsc 
  SLEPc                   no
[...]  
```

If for some reason one of the optional dependencies is available but
FeenoX should not use it, then pass `--without-sundials`,
`--without-petsc` and/or `--without-slepc` as arguments. For example

``` terminal
$ ./configure --without-sundials --without-petsc
[...]
## ----------------------- ##
## Summary of dependencies ##
## ----------------------- ##
  GNU Scientific Library  from system
  SUNDIALS                no
  PETSc                   no
  SLEPc                   no
[...]  
```

If configure complains about contradicting values from the cached ones,
run `autogen.sh` again before `configure` and/or clone/uncompress the
source tarball in a fresh location.

To see all the available options run

``` terminal
./configure --help
```

  [GNU Coding Standards]: https://www.gnu.org/prep/standards/
  [GNU Scientific Library]: https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/

## Source code compilation

After the successful execution of `configure`, a `Makefile` is created.
To compile FeenoX, just execute

``` terminal
make
```

Compilation should take a dozen of seconds. It can be even sped up by
using the `-j` option

``` terminal
make -j8
```

The binary executable will be located in the `src` directory but a copy
will be made in the base directory as well. Test it by running without
any arguments

``` terminal
$ ./feenox
FeenoX v0.2.14-gbbf48c9
a free no-fee no-X uniX-like finite-element(ish) computational engineering tool

usage: feenox [options] inputfile [replacement arguments] [petsc options]

  -h, --help         display options and detailed explanations of command-line usage
  -v, --version      display brief version information and exit
  -V, --versions     display detailed version information

Run with --help for further explanations.
$
```

The `-v` (or `--version`) option shows the version and a copyright
notice:

``` terminal
$ ./feenox -v

## Test suite

The [`test`] directory contains a set of test cases whose output is
known so that unintended regressions can be detected quickly (see the
[programming guide] for more information). The test suite ought to be
run after each modification in FeenoX’s source code. It consists of a
set of scripts and input files needed to solve dozens of cases. The
output of each execution is compared to a reference solution. In case
the output does not match the reference, the test suite fails.

After compiling FeenoX as explained in sec. 2.5, the test suite can be
run with `make check`. Ideally everything should be green meaning the
tests passed:

``` terminal
$ make check
Making check in src
make[1]: Entering directory '/home/gtheler/codigos/feenox/src'
make[1]: Nothing to be done for 'check'.
make[1]: Leaving directory '/home/gtheler/codigos/feenox/src'

The `XFAIL` result means that those cases are expected to fail (they are
there to test if FeenoX can handle errors). Failure would mean they
passed. In case FeenoX was not compiled with any optional dependency,
the corresponding tests will be skipped. Skipped tests do not mean any
failure, but that the compiled FeenoX executable does not have the full
capabilities. For example, when configuring with
`./configure --without-petsc` (but with SUNDIALS), the test suite output
should be a mixture of green and blue:

``` terminal
$ ./configure --without-petsc

To illustrate how regressions can be detected, let us add a bug
deliberately and re-run the test suite.

Edit the source file that contains the shape functions of the
second-order tetrahedra `src/mesh/tet10.c`, find the function
`feenox_mesh_tet10_h()` and randomly change a sign, i.e. replace

``` c
      return t*(2*t-1);
```

with

``` c
      return t*(2*t+1);
```

Save, recompile, and re-run the test suite to obtain some red:

``` terminal
$ git diff src/mesh/
diff --git a/src/mesh/tet10.c b/src/mesh/tet10.c
index 72bc838..293c290 100644

## Installation

To be able to execute FeenoX from any directory, the binary has to be
copied to a directory available in the `PATH` environment variable. If
you have root access, the easiest and cleanest way of doing this is by
calling `make install` with `sudo` or `su`:

``` terminal
$ sudo make install
Making install in src
make[1]: Entering directory '/home/gtheler/codigos/feenox/src'
gmake[2]: Entering directory '/home/gtheler/codigos/feenox/src'
 /usr/bin/mkdir -p '/usr/local/bin'
  /usr/bin/install -c feenox '/usr/local/bin'
gmake[2]: Nothing to be done for 'install-data-am'.
gmake[2]: Leaving directory '/home/gtheler/codigos/feenox/src'
make[1]: Leaving directory '/home/gtheler/codigos/feenox/src'
make[1]: Entering directory '/home/gtheler/codigos/feenox'
cp -r src/feenox .
make[2]: Entering directory '/home/gtheler/codigos/feenox'
make[2]: Nothing to be done for 'install-exec-am'.
make[2]: Nothing to be done for 'install-data-am'.
make[2]: Leaving directory '/home/gtheler/codigos/feenox'
make[1]: Leaving directory '/home/gtheler/codigos/feenox'
$
```

If you do not have root access or do not want to populate
`/usr/local/bin`, you can either

- Configure with a different prefix (not covered here), or

- Copy (or symlink) the `feenox` executable to `$HOME/bin`:

  ``` terminal
  mkdir -p ${HOME}/bin
  cp feenox ${HOME}/bin
  ```

  If you plan to regularly update FeenoX (which you should), you might
  want to symlink instead of copy so you do not need to update the
  binary in `$HOME/bin` each time you recompile:

  ``` terminal
  mkdir -p ${HOME}/bin
  ln -sf feenox ${HOME}/bin
  ```

Check that FeenoX is now available from any directory (note the command
is `feenox` and not `./feenox`):

``` terminal
$ cd
$ feenox -v
FeenoX v0.2.14-gbbf48c9
a free no-fee no-X uniX-like finite-element(ish) computational engineering tool

```

If it is not and you went through the `$HOME/bin` path, make sure it is
in the `PATH` (pun). Add

``` c
export PATH=${PATH}:${HOME}/bin
```

to your `.bashrc` in your home directory and re-login.

# Advanced settings

## Compiling with debug symbols

By default the C flags are `-O3`, without debugging. To add the `-g`
flag, just use `CFLAGS` when configuring:

``` terminal
./configure CFLAGS="-g -O0"
```

## Using a different compiler

FeenoX uses the `CC` environment variable to set the compiler. So
configure like

``` terminal
export CC=clang; ./configure
```

Note that the `CC` variable has to be *exported* and not *passed* to
configure. That is to say, don’t configure like

``` terminal
./configure CC=clang
```

Mind also the following environment variables when using MPI-enabled
PETSc:

- `MPICH_CC`
- `OMPI_CC`
- `I_MPI_CC`

Depending on how your system is configured, this last command might show
`clang` but not actually use it. The FeenoX executable will show the
configured compiler and flags when invoked with the `--versions` option:

``` terminal
$ feenox --versions
FeenoX v0.2.14-gbbf48c9
a free no-fee no-X uniX-like finite-element(ish) computational engineering tool

It should be noted that the MPI implementation used to compile FeenoX
has to match the one used to compile PETSc. Therefore, if you compiled
PETSc on your own, it is up to you to ensure MPI compatibility. If you
are using PETSc as provided by your distribution’s repositories, you
will have to find out which one was used (it is usually OpenMPI) and use
the same one when compiling FeenoX. FeenoX has been tested using PETSc
compiled with

- MPICH
- OpenMPI
- Intel MPI

## Compiling PETSc

Particular explanation for FeenoX is to be done. For now, follow the
[general explanation from PETSc’s website].

``` terminal
export PETSC_DIR=$PWD
export PETSC_ARCH=arch-linux-c-opt
./configure --with-debugging=0 --download-mumps --download-scalapack --with-cxx=0 --COPTFLAGS=-O3 --FOPTFLAGS=-O3 
```

``` terminal
export PETSC_DIR=$PWD
./configure --with-debugging=0 --with-openmp=0 --with-x=0 --with-cxx=0 --COPTFLAGS=-O3 --FOPTFLAGS=-O3 
make PETSC_DIR=/home/ubuntu/reflex-deps/petsc-3.17.2 PETSC_ARCH=arch-linux-c-opt all
```
