# Quality assurance {#sec:qa}

**TO BE COMPLETED**

Since the results obtained with the tools might be used in verifying existing equipment or in designing new mechanical parts in sensitive industries, a certain level of software quality assurance is needed. Some best-practices for developing generic software are required such as

 * employment of a version control system,
 * automated testing suites,
 * user-reported bug tracking support.
 * etc.

but since the tool falls in the category of engineering computational software, verification and validation procedures are also mandatory, as discussed below. Design should be such that governance of engineering data including problem definition, results and documentation can be efficiently performed using state-of-the-art methodologies.
