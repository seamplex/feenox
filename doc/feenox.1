.SH NAME
FeenoX \- a cloud\-first free no\-X uniX\-like finite\-element(ish)
computational engineering tool
.SH SYNOPSIS
The basic usage is to execute the \f[B]feenox\f[R] binary passing a path
to an input file that defines the problem, along with other options and
command\-line replacement arguments which are explained below:
.PP
\f[B]feenox\f[R] [\f[I]options\f[R] \&...]
\f[I]input\-file\f[R]
[\f[I]optional_commandline_replacement_arguments\f[R] \&...]
.PP
For large problems that do not fit in a single computer, a parallel run
using \f[B]mpirun\f[R]\f[CR](1)\f[R] will be needed:
.PP
\f[B]mpirun\f[R] \f[B]\-n\f[R] \f[I]number_of_threads\f[R]

\f[I]input\-file\f[R]
[\f[I]optional_commandline_replacement_arguments\f[R] \&...]
.SH DESCRIPTION
FeenoX is a computational tool that can solve engineering problems which
are usually casted as differential\-algebraic equations (DAEs) or
partial differential equations (PDEs).
It is to finite elements programs and libraries what Markdown is to Word
and TeX, respectively.
In particular, it can solve
.IP \[bu] 2
dynamical systems defined by a set of user\-provided DAEs (such as plant
control dynamics for example)
.IP \[bu] 2
mechanical elasticity
.IP \[bu] 2
heat conduction
.IP \[bu] 2
structural modal analysis
.IP \[bu] 2
neutron diffusion
.IP \[bu] 2
neutron transport
.PP
FeenoX reads a plain\-text input file which contains the problem
definition and writes 100%\-user defined results in ASCII (through
\f[CR]PRINT\f[R] or other user\-defined output instructions within the
input file).
For PDE problems, it needs a reference to at least one Gmsh mesh file
for the discretization of the domain.
It can write post\-processing views in either \f[CR].msh\f[R],
\f[CR].vtu\f[R] or \f[CR].vtk\f[R] formats.
.PP
Keep in mind that FeenoX is just a back end reading a set of input files
and writing a set of output files following the design philosophy of
Unix (separation, composition, representation, economy, extensibility,
etc).
Think of it as a transfer function (or a filter in computer\-science
jargon) between input files and output files:
.IP
.EX
                             +\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-+
 mesh (*.msh)  }             |            |             { terminal
 data (*.dat)  } input \-\-\-\-> |   FeenoX   |\-\-\-\-> output { data files
 input (*.fee) }             |            |             { post (vtk/msh)
                             +\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-+
.EE
.PP
Following the Unix programming philosophy, there are no graphical
interfaces attached to the FeenoX core, although a wide variety of pre
and post\-processors can be used with FeenoX.
To illustrate the transfer\-function approach, consider the following
input file that solves Laplace\[cq]s equation ∇^2^\f[I]ϕ\f[R] = 0 on a
square with some space\-dependent boundary conditions:
.PP
\f[I]ϕ\f[R](\f[I]x\f[R], \f[I]y\f[R]) = +\f[I]y\f[R]   for
\f[I]x\f[R] = −1 (left)
.PP

\f[I]x\f[R] = +1 (right)
.PP
∇\f[I]ϕ\f[R] ⋅ \f[I]n̂\f[R] = sin (\f[I]π\f[R]/2\f[I]x\f[R])   for

.EE
.PP
The optional \f[CR][replacement arguments]\f[R] part of the command line
mean that each argument after the input file that does not start with an
hyphen will be expanded verbatim in the input file in each occurrence of
\f[CR]$1\f[R], \f[CR]$2\f[R], etc.
For example

PETSc and SLEPc options can be passed in \f[CR][petsc options]\f[R] (or
\f[CR][options]\f[R]) as well, with the difference that two hyphens have
to be used instead of only once.
For example, to pass the PETSc option \f[CR]\-ksp_view\f[R] the actual
FeenoX invocation should be
.IP
.EX
$ feenox input.fee \-\-ksp_view

.SS \f[CR]ABORT\f[R]
.PP
Catastrophically abort the execution and quit FeenoX.
.IP
.EX
ABORT  
.EE
.PP
Whenever the instruction \f[CR]ABORT\f[R] is executed, FeenoX quits with
a non\-zero error leve.
It does not close files nor unlock shared memory objects.
The objective of this instruction is to either debug complex input files
by using only parts of them or to conditionally abort the execution
using \f[CR]IF\f[R] clauses.
.SS \f[CR]ALIAS\f[R]
.PP
Define a scalar alias of an already\-defined identifier.
.IP
.EX
ALIAS { <new_var_name> IS <existing_object> | <existing_object> AS <new_name> }  
.EE
.PP
The existing object can be a variable, a vector element or a matrix
element.
In the first case, the name of the variable should be given as the
existing object.
In the second case, to alias the second element of vector \f[CR]v\f[R]
to the new name \f[CR]new\f[R], \f[CR]v(2)\f[R] should be given as the
existing object.
In the third case, to alias second element (2,3) of matrix \f[CR]M\f[R]
to the new name \f[CR]new\f[R], \f[CR]M(2,3)\f[R] should be given as the
existing object.
.SS \f[CR]CLOSE\f[R]
.PP
Explicitly close a file after input/output.
.IP
.EX
CLOSE <name>  
.EE
.PP
The given \f[CR]<name>\f[R] can be either a fixed\-string path or an
already\-defined \f[CR]FILE\f[R].
.SS \f[CR]DEFAULT_ARGUMENT_VALUE\f[R]
.PP
Give a default value for an optional commandline argument.
.IP
.EX
DEFAULT_ARGUMENT_VALUE <constant> <string>  
.EE
.PP
If a \f[CR]$n\f[R] construction is found in the input file but the
commandline argument was not given, the default behavior is to fail
complaining that an extra argument has to be given in the commandline.
With this keyword, a default value can be assigned if no argument is
given, thus avoiding the failure and making the argument optional.
The \f[CR]<constant>\f[R] should be 1, 2, 3, etc.
and \f[CR]<string>\f[R] will be expanded character\-by\-character where
the \f[CR]$n\f[R] construction is.
Whether the resulting expression is to be interpreted as a string or as
a numerical expression will depend on the context.
.SS \f[CR]FILE\f[R]
.PP
Define a file with a particularly formatted name to be used either as
input or as output.
.IP
.EX
< FILE | OUTPUT_FILE | INPUT_FILE > <name> PATH <format> expr_1 expr_2 ... expr_n [ INPUT | OUTPUT | APPEND | MODE <fopen_mode> ]  
.EE
.PP
For reading or writing into files with a fixed path, this instruction is
usually not needed as the \f[CR]FILE\f[R] keyword of other instructions
(such as \f[CR]PRINT\f[R] or \f[CR]MESH\f[R]) can take a fixed\-string
path as an argument.
However, if the file name changes as the execution progresses (say
because one file for each step is needed), then an explicit
\f[CR]FILE\f[R] needs to be defined with this keyword and later
referenced by the given name.
.PD 0
.P
.PD
The path should be given as a \f[CR]printf\f[R]\-like format string
followed by the expressions which should be evaluated in order to obtain
the actual file path.
The expressions will always be floating\-point expressions, but the
particular integer specifier \f[CR]%d\f[R] is allowed and internally
transformed to \f[CR]%.0f\f[R].
The file can be explicitly defined and \f[CR]INPUT\f[R],
\f[CR]OUTPUT\f[R] or a certain \f[CR]fopen()\f[R] mode can be given
(i.e.\ \[lq]a\[rq]).
If not explicitly given, the nature of the file will be taken from
context, i.e.\ \f[CR]FILE\f[R]s in \f[CR]PRINT\f[R] will be
\f[CR]OUTPUT\f[R] and \f[CR]FILE\f[R]s in \f[CR]FUNCTION\f[R] will be
\f[CR]INPUT\f[R].
This keyword just defines the \f[CR]FILE\f[R], it does not open it.
The file will be actually opened (and eventually closed) automatically.
In the rare case where the automated opening and closing does not fit
the expected workflow, the file can be explicitly opened or closed with
the instructions \f[CR]FILE_OPEN\f[R] and \f[CR]FILE_CLOSE\f[R].
.SS \f[CR]FIT\f[R]
.PP
Find parameters to fit an analytical function to a pointwise\-defined
function.
.IP
.EX
FIT <function_to_be_fitted>  TO <function_with_data> VIA <var_1> <var_2> ... <var_n>
 [ GRADIENT <expr_1> <expr_2> ... <expr_n> ]
 [ RANGE_MIN <expr_1> <expr_2> ... <expr_j> ]
 [ RANGE_MAX <expr_1> <expr_2> ... <expr_n> ]
 [ TOL_REL <expr> ] [ TOL_ABS <expr> ] [ MAX_ITER <expr> ]
 [ VERBOSE ]  
.EE
.PP
The function with the data has to be point\-wise defined (i.e.\ a
\f[CR]FUNCTION\f[R] read from a file, with inline \f[CR]DATA\f[R] or
defined over a mesh).
The function to be fitted has to be parametrized with at least one of
the variables provided after the \f[CR]USING\f[R] keyword.
For example to
fit\ \f[I]f\f[R](\f[I]x\f[R], \f[I]y\f[R]) = \f[I]a\f[R]\f[I]x\f[R]^2^ + \f[I]b\f[R]\f[I]s\f[R]\f[I]q\f[R]\f[I]r\f[R]\f[I]t\f[R](\f[I]y\f[R])
to a pointwise\-defined function\ \f[I]g\f[R](\f[I]x\f[R], \f[I]y\f[R])
one gives \f[CR]FIT f TO g VIA a b\f[R].
Only the names of the functions have to be given, not the arguments.
Both functions have to have the same number of arguments.
The initial guess of the solution is given by the initial value of the
variables after the \f[CR]VIA\f[R] keyword.
Analytical expressions for the gradient of the function to be fitted
with respect to the parameters to be fitted can be optionally given with
the \f[CR]GRADIENT\f[R] keyword.
If none is provided, the gradient will be computed numerically using
finite differences.
A range over which the residuals are to be minimized can be given with
\f[CR]RANGE_MIN\f[R] and \f[CR]RANGE_MAX\f[R].
The expressions give the range of the arguments of the functions, not of
the parameters.
For multidimensional fits, the range is an hypercube.
If no range is given, all the definition points of the function with the
data are used for the fit.
Convergence can be controlled by giving the relative and absolute
tolreances with \f[CR]TOL_REL\f[R] (default
\f[CR]DEFAULT_NLIN_FIT_EPSREL\f[R]) and \f[CR]TOL_ABS\f[R] (default
\f[CR]DEFAULT_NLIN_FIT_EPSABS\f[R]), and with the maximum number of
iterations \f[CR]MAX_ITER\f[R] (default DEFAULT_NLIN_FIT_MAX_ITER).
If the optional keyword \f[CR]VERBOSE\f[R] is given, some data of the
intermediate steps is written in the standard output.
.SS \f[CR]FUNCTION\f[R]
.PP
Define a scalar function of one or more variables.
.IP
.EX

   = <expr> | 
   FILE { <file> } |

 [ INTERPOLATION_THRESHOLD <expr> ] [ SHEPARD_RADIUS <expr> ] [ SHEPARD_EXPONENT <expr> ]  
.EE
.PP
The number of variables \f[I]n\f[R] is given by the number of arguments
given between parenthesis after the function name.
The arguments are defined as new variables if they had not been already
defined explicitly as scalar variables.
If the function is given as an algebraic expression, the short\-hand
operator \f[CR]=\f[R] (or \f[CR]:=\f[R] for compatibility with Maxima)
can be used.
That is to say, \f[CR]FUNCTION f(x) = x\[ha]2\f[R] is equivalent to
\f[CR]f(x) = x\[ha]2\f[R] (or \f[CR]f(x) := x\[ha]2\f[R]).
If a \f[CR]FILE\f[R] is given, an ASCII file containing at least
\f[I]n\f[R] + 1 columns is expected.
By default, the first \f[I]n\f[R] columns are the values of the
arguments and the last column is the value of the function at those
points.
The order of the columns can be changed with the keyword
\f[CR]COLUMNS\f[R], which expects \f[I]n\f[R] + 1 expressions
corresponding to the column numbers.
If \f[CR]VECTORS\f[R] is given, a set of \f[I]n\f[R] + 1 vectors of the
same size is expected.
The first \f[I]n\f[R] correspond to the arguments and the last one to
the function values.
If \f[CR]MESH\f[R] is given, the function is point\-wise defined over
the mesh topology.
That is to say, the independent variables (i.e.\ the spatial
coordinates) coincide with the mesh nodes.
The dependent variable (i.e.\ the function value) is set by
\[lq]filling\[rq] a vector named \f[CR]vec_f\f[R] (where \f[CR]f\f[R]
has to be replaced with the function name) of size equal to the number
of nodes.
.PD 0
.P
.PD
The function can be pointwise\-defined inline in the input using
\f[CR]DATA\f[R].
This should be the last keyword of the line, followed by
\f[I]N\f[R] = \f[I]k\f[R] ⋅ (\f[I]n\f[R] + 1) expressions
giving\ \f[I]k\f[R] definition points: \f[I]n\f[R] arguments and the
value of the function.
Multiline continuation using brackets \f[CR]{\f[R] and \f[CR]}\f[R] can
be used for a clean data organization.
Interpolation schemes can be given for either one or multi\-dimensional
functions with \f[CR]INTERPOLATION\f[R].
Available schemes for \f[I]n\f[R] = 1 are:
.IP \[bu] 2
linear
.IP \[bu] 2
polynomial, the grade is equal to the number of data minus one
.IP \[bu] 2
spline, cubic (needs at least 3 points)
.IP \[bu] 2
spline_periodic
.IP \[bu] 2
akima (needs at least 5 points)
.IP \[bu] 2
akima_periodic (needs at least 5 points)
.IP \[bu] 2
steffen, always\-monotonic splines\-like interpolator
.PP
Default interpolation scheme for one\-dimensional functions is
\f[CR]DEFAULT_INTERPOLATION\f[R].
.PP
Available schemes for \f[I]n\f[R] > 1 are:
.IP \[bu] 2
nearest, \f[I]f\f[R](\f[I]x⃗\f[R]) is equal to the value of the closest
definition point
.IP \[bu] 2
shepard, inverse distance weighted average definition points (might lead
to inefficient evaluation)
.IP \[bu] 2
shepard_kd, average of definition points within a kd\-tree (more
efficient evaluation provided \f[CR]SHEPARD_RADIUS\f[R] is set to a
proper value)
.IP \[bu] 2
bilinear, only available if the definition points configure an
structured hypercube\-like grid.
If \f[I]n\f[R] > 3, \f[CR]SIZES\f[R] should be given.
.PP
For \f[I]n\f[R] > 1, if the euclidean distance between the arguments and
the definition points is smaller than
\f[CR]INTERPOLATION_THRESHOLD\f[R], the definition point is returned and
no interpolation is performed.
Default value is square root of
\f[CR]DEFAULT_MULTIDIM_INTERPOLATION_THRESHOLD\f[R].
.PP
The initial radius of points to take into account in
\f[CR]shepard_kd\f[R] is given by \f[CR]SHEPARD_RADIUS\f[R].
If no points are found, the radius is double until at least one
definition point is found.
The radius is doubled until at least one point is found.
Default is \f[CR]DEFAULT_SHEPARD_RADIUS\f[R].
The exponent of the \f[CR]shepard\f[R] method is given by
\f[CR]SHEPARD_EXPONENT\f[R].
Default is \f[CR]DEFAULT_SHEPARD_EXPONENT\f[R].
.SS \f[CR]IF\f[R]

.SS \f[CR]IMPLICIT\f[R]
.PP
Define whether implicit definition of variables is allowed or not.
.IP
.EX
IMPLICIT { NONE | ALLOWED }  
.EE
.PP
By default, FeenoX allows variables (but not vectors nor matrices) to be
implicitly declared.
To avoid introducing errors due to typos, explicit declaration of
variables can be forced by giving \f[CR]IMPLICIT NONE\f[R].
Whether implicit declaration is allowed or explicit declaration is
required depends on the last \f[CR]IMPLICIT\f[R] keyword given, which by
default is \f[CR]ALLOWED\f[R].
.SS \f[CR]INCLUDE\f[R]
.PP
Include another FeenoX input file.
.IP
.EX
INCLUDE <file_path> [ FROM <num_expr> ] [ TO <num_expr> ]  
.EE
.PP
Includes the input file located in the string \f[CR]file_path\f[R] at
the current location.
The effect is the same as copying and pasting the contents of the
included file at the location of the \f[CR]INCLUDE\f[R] keyword.
The path can be relative or absolute.
Note, however, that when including files inside \f[CR]IF\f[R] blocks
that instructions are conditionally\-executed but all definitions (such
as function definitions) are processed at parse\-time independently from
the evaluation of the conditional.
The included file has to be an actual file path (i.e.\ it cannot be a
FeenoX \f[CR]FILE\f[R]) because it needs to be resolved at parse time.
Yet, the name can contain a commandline replacement argument such as
\f[CR]$1\f[R] so \f[CR]INCLUDE $1.fee\f[R] will include the file
specified after the main input file in the command line.
The optional \f[CR]FROM\f[R] and \f[CR]TO\f[R] keywords can be used to
include only portions of a file.
.SS \f[CR]MATRIX\f[R]
.PP
Define a matrix.
.IP
.EX
MATRIX <name> ROWS <expr> COLS <expr> [ DATA <expr_1> <expr_2> ... <expr_n> |  
.EE
.PP
A new matrix of the prescribed size is defined.
The number of rows and columns can be an expression which will be
evaluated the very first time the matrix is used and then kept at those
constant values.
All elements will be initialized to zero unless \f[CR]DATA\f[R] is given
(which should be the last keyword of the line), in which case the
expressions will be evaluated the very first time the matrix is used and
row\-major\-assigned to each of the elements.
If there are less elements than the matrix size, the remaining values
will be zero.
If there are more elements than the matrix size, the values will be
ignored.
.SS \f[CR]OPEN\f[R]
.PP
Explicitly open a file for input/output.
.IP
.EX
OPEN <name> [ MODE <fopen_mode> ]  
.EE
.PP
The given \f[CR]<name>\f[R] can be either a fixed\-string path or an
already\-defined \f[CR]FILE\f[R].
The mode is only taken into account if the file is not already defined.
Default is write \f[CR]w\f[R].
.SS \f[CR]PRINT\f[R]
.PP
Write plain\-text and/or formatted data to the standard output or into
an output file.
.IP
.EX
PRINT [ <object_1> <object_2> ... <object_n> ] [ TEXT <string_1> ... TEXT <string_n> ]

 [ SKIP_STEP <expr> ] [ SKIP_STATIC_STEP <expr> ] [ SKIP_TIME <expr> ] [ SKIP_HEADER_STEP <expr> ] 
  
.EE
.PP
Each argument \f[CR]object\f[R] which is not a keyword of the
\f[CR]PRINT\f[R] instruction will be part of the output.
Objects can be either a matrix, a vector or any valid scalar algebraic
expression.
If the given object cannot be solved into a valid matrix, vector or
expression, it is treated as a string literal if \f[CR]IMPLICIT\f[R] is
\f[CR]ALLOWED\f[R], otherwise a parser error is raised.
To explicitly interpret an object as a literal string even if it
resolves to a valid numerical expression, it should be prefixed with the
\f[CR]TEXT\f[R] keyword such as \f[CR]PRINT TEXT 1+1\f[R] that would
print \f[CR]1+1\f[R] instead of \f[CR]2\f[R].
Objects and string literals can be mixed and given in any order.
Hashes \f[CR]#\f[R] appearing literal in text strings have to be quoted
to prevent the parser to treat them as comments within the FeenoX input
file and thus ignoring the rest of the line, like
\f[CR]PRINT \[dq]\[rs]# this is a printed comment\[dq]\f[R].
Whenever an argument starts with a porcentage sign \f[CR]%\f[R], it is
treated as a C \f[CR]printf\f[R]\-compatible format specifier and all
the objects that follow it are printed using the given format until a
new format definition is found.
The objects are treated as double\-precision floating point numbers, so
only floating point formats should be given.
See the \f[CR]printf(3)\f[R] man page for further details.
The default format is \f[CR]DEFAULT_PRINT_FORMAT\f[R].
Matrices, vectors, scalar expressions, format modifiers and string
literals can be given in any desired order, and are processed from left
to right.
Vectors are printed element\-by\-element in a single row.
See \f[CR]PRINT_VECTOR\f[R] to print one or more vectors with one
element per line (i.e.\ vertically).
Matrices are printed element\-by\-element in a single line using
row\-major ordering if mixed with other objects but in the natural row
and column fashion if it is the only given object in the
\f[CR]PRINT\f[R] instruction.
If the \f[CR]FILE\f[R] keyword is not provided, default is to write to
\f[CR]stdout\f[R].
If the \f[CR]HEADER\f[R] keyword is given, a single line containing the
literal text given for each object is printed at the very first time the
\f[CR]PRINT\f[R] instruction is processed, starting with a hash
\f[CR]#\f[R] character.

If the \f[CR]NONEWLINE\f[R] keyword is not provided, default is to write
a newline \f[CR]\[rs]n\f[R] character after all the objects are
processed.
Otherwise, if the last token to be printed is a numerical value, a
separator string will be printed but not the newline \f[CR]\[rs]n\f[R]
character.
If the last token is a string, neither the separator nor the newline
will be printed.
The \f[CR]SEP\f[R] keyword expects a string used to separate printed
objects.
To print objects without any separation in between give an empty string
like \f[CR]SEP \[dq]\[dq]\f[R].
The default is a tabulator character `DEFAULT_PRINT_SEPARATOR'
character.
To print an empty line write \f[CR]PRINT\f[R] without arguments.
By default the \f[CR]PRINT\f[R] instruction is evaluated every step.
If the \f[CR]SKIP_STEP\f[R] (\f[CR]SKIP_STATIC_STEP\f[R]) keyword is
given, the instruction is processed only every the number of transient
(static) steps that results in evaluating the expression, which may not
be constant.
The \f[CR]SKIP_HEADER_STEP\f[R] keyword works similarly for the optional
\f[CR]HEADER\f[R] but by default it is only printed once.
The \f[CR]SKIP_TIME\f[R] keyword use time advancements to choose how to
skip printing and may be useful for non\-constant time\-step problems.

When implicit definition is allowed (see \f[CR]IMPLICIT\f[R]), scalar
variables need not to be defined before being used if from the context
FeenoX can tell that an scalar variable is needed.
For instance, when defining a function like \f[CR]f(x) = x\[ha]2\f[R] it
is not needed to declare \f[CR]x\f[R] explicitly as a scalar variable.
But if one wants to define a function like
\f[CR]g(x) = integral(f(x\[aq]), x\[aq], 0, x)\f[R] then the variable
\f[CR]x\[aq]\f[R] needs to be explicitly defined as

The sizes of both the function and the vector should match.
All elements will be initialized to zero unless \f[CR]DATA\f[R] is given

If there are less elements than the vector size, the remaining values

If the boundary condition applies to more than one physical group in the

needed.
Each \f[CR]<bc_data>\f[R] argument is a single string whose meaning
depends on the type of problem being solved.
For instance \f[CR]T=150*sin(x/pi)\f[R] prescribes the temperature to

See the particular section on boundary conditions for further details.

If either \f[CR]GROUP\f[R] or \f[CR]GROUPS\f[R] are given explicitly,

By default the integration is performed over the highest\-dimensional

three, two and one\-dimensional meshes, respectively.
If the integration is to be carried out over just a physical group, it

If there are more than one mesh defined, an explicit one has to be given

Either \f[CR]GAUSS\f[R] or \f[CR]CELLS\f[R] define how the integration

With \f[CR]GAUSS\f[R] the integration is performed using the Gauss
points and weights associated to each element type.
With \f[CR]CELLS\f[R] the integral is computed as the sum of the product
of the integrand at the center of each cell (element) and the cell\[cq]s
volume.
Do expect differences in the results and efficiency between these two

If the name of the material matches a physical group in the mesh, it is

If the material applies to more than one physical group in the mesh,
they can be added using as many \f[CR]LABEL\f[R] keywords as needed.
The names of the properties in principle can be arbitrary, but each
problem type needs a minimum set of properties defined with particular
names.
For example, steady\-state thermal problems need at least the
conductivity which should be named\ \f[CR]k\f[R].
If the problem is transient, it will also need heat
capacity\ \f[CR]rhocp\f[R] or diffusivity\ \f[CR]alpha\f[R].
Mechanical problems need Young modulus\ \f[CR]E\f[R] and Poisson\[cq]s
ratio\ \f[CR]nu\f[R].
Modal also needs density\ \f[CR]rho\f[R].
Check the particular documentation for each problem type.
Besides these mandatory properties, any other one can be defined.
For instance, if one mandatory property depended on the concentration of
boron in the material, a new per\-material property can be added named
\f[CR]boron\f[R] and then the function \f[CR]boron(x,y,z)\f[R] can be

This keyword should seldom be needed.
Most of the times, a combination of \f[CR]MATERIAL\f[R] and

The name of the \f[CR]PHYSICAL_GROUP\f[R] keyword should match the name

If there is no physical group with the provided name in the mesh, this
instruction has no effect.
If there are many meshes, an explicit mesh can be given with

Otherwise, the physical group is defined on the main mesh.
An explicit dimension of the physical group can be provided with
\f[CR]DIMENSION\f[R].
An explicit id can be given with \f[CR]ID\f[R].
Both dimension and id should match the values in the mesh.
For volumetric elements, physical groups can be linked to materials
using \f[CR]MATERIAL\f[R].
Note that if a material is created with the same name as a physical
group in the mesh, they will be linked automatically, so there is no
need to use \f[CR]PHYSCAL_GROUP\f[R] for this.
The \f[CR]MATERIAL\f[R] keyword in \f[CR]PHYSICAL_GROUP\f[R] is used to
link a physical group in a mesh file and a material in the feenox input
file with different names.
.PP
Likewise, for non\-volumetric elements, physical groups can be linked to
boundary using \f[CR]BC\f[R].
As in the preceding case, if a boundary condition is created with the
same name as a physical group in the mesh, they will be linked
automatically, so there is no need to use \f[CR]PHYSCAL_GROUP\f[R] for
this.
The \f[CR]BC\f[R] keyword in \f[CR]PHYSICAL_GROUP\f[R] is used to link a
physical group in a mesh file and a boundary condition in the feenox

Default is 3D.
If the \f[CR]AXISYMMETRIC\f[R] keyword is given, the mesh is expected to
be two\-dimensional in the \f[I]x\f[R]\-\f[I]y\f[R] plane and the
problem is assumed to be axi\-symmetric around the given axis.
If there are more than one \f[CR]MESH\f[R]es defined, the one over which
the problem is to be solved can be defined by giving the explicit mesh
name with \f[CR]MESH\f[R].
By default, the first mesh to be defined in the input file with
\f[CR]READ_MESH\f[R] (which can be defined after the \f[CR]PROBLEM\f[R]
keyword) is the one over which the problem is solved.
If the keyword \f[CR]PROGRESS\f[R] is given, three ASCII lines will show
in the terminal the progress of the ensamble of the stiffness matrix (or
matrices), the solution of the system of equations and the computation
of gradients (stresses, heat fluxes, etc.), if applicable.
If either \f[CR]DETECT_HANGING_NODES\f[R] or
\f[CR]HANDLE_HANGING_NODES\f[R] are given, an intermediate check for
nodes without any associated elements will be performed.
For well\-behaved meshes this check is redundant so by default it is not
done (\f[CR]DO_NOT_DETEC_HANGING_NODES\f[R]).
With \f[CR]DETECT_HANGING_NODES\f[R], FeenoX will report the tag of the
hanging nodes and stop.
With \f[CR]HANDLE_HANGING_NODES\f[R], FeenoX will fix those nodes and
try to solve the problem anyway.
By default, FeenoX checks that all physical groups referred to in the
\f[CR]BC\f[R] keywords exists (\f[CR]DETECT_UNRESOLVED_BCS\f[R]).
If \f[CR]ALLOW_UNRESOLVED_BCS\f[R] is given, FeenoX will ignore
unresolved boundary conditions instead of complaining.
This is handy when using the same input for different meshes which might
have different groups, for example solving the same problem using a full
geometry or a symmetric geometry.
The latter should have at least one symmetry BC whilst the former does
not.
If the special variable \f[CR]end_time\f[R] is zero, FeenoX solves a
static problem\[em]although the variable \f[CR]static_steps\f[R] is
still honored.
If \f[CR]end_time\f[R] is non\-zero, FeenoX solves a transient or
quasi\-static problem.
This can be controlled by \f[CR]TRANSIENT\f[R] or
\f[CR]QUASISTATIC\f[R].
By default FeenoX tries to detect whether the computation should be
linear or non\-linear.
An explicit mode can be set with either \f[CR]LINEAR\f[R] on
\f[CR]NON_LINEAR\f[R].
The number of modes to be computed when solving eigenvalue problems is
given by \f[CR]MODES\f[R].
The default value is problem dependent.
The preconditioner (\f[CR]PC\f[R]), linear (\f[CR]KSP\f[R]), non\-linear
(\f[CR]SNES\f[R]) and time\-stepper (\f[CR]TS\f[R]) solver types be any
of those available in PETSc (first option is the default):

Default is \f[CR]lambda\f[R], although some particular PDEs might change
it (for example free\-free modal switches to \f[CR]omega\f[R]).
The \f[CR]EIGEN_DIRICHLET_ZERO\f[R] keyword controls which of the
matrices has a zero and which one has a non\-zero in the diagonal when
setting Dirichlet boundary conditions.
Default is \f[CR]M\f[R], i.e.\ matrix\ \f[I]K\f[R] has a non\-zero and
matrix\ \f[I]M\f[R] has a zero.
This setting, along with \f[CR]EIGEN_FORMULATION\f[R] determines which
spectral transforms can a cannot be used: you cannot invert the matrix
with the zero in the diagonal.
The \f[CR]DIRICHLET_SCALING\f[R] keyword controls the way Dirichlet
boundary conditions are scaled when computing the residual.
Roughly, it defines how to compute the parameter\ \f[I]α\f[R].
If \f[CR]absolute\f[R], then \f[I]α\f[R] is equal to the given
expression.
If \f[CR]relative\f[R], then \f[I]α\f[R] is equal to the given fraction
of the average diagonal entries in the stiffness matrix.
Default is\ \f[I]α\f[R] = 1.

Note than only MSH is suitable for defining PDE domains, as it is the
only one that provides physical groups (a.k.a labels) which are needed
in order to define materials and boundary conditions.
The other formats are primarily supported to read function data
contained in the file and eventually, to operate over these functions
(i.e.\ take differences with other functions contained in other files to
compare results).
The file path or file id can be used to refer to a particular mesh when
reading more than one, for instance in a \f[CR]WRITE_MESH\f[R] or
\f[CR]INTEGRATE\f[R] keyword.
If a file path is given such as \f[CR]cool_mesh.msh\f[R], it can be
later referred to as either \f[CR]cool_mesh.msh\f[R] or just
\f[CR]cool_mesh\f[R].

The spatial dimensions can be given with \f[CR]DIM\f[R].
If material properties are uniform and given with variables, the number
of dimensions are not needed and will be read from the file at runtime.
But if either properties are given by spatial functions or if functions
are to be read from the mesh with \f[CR]READ_DATA\f[R] or
\f[CR]READ_FUNCTION\f[R], then the number of dimensions ought to be
given explicitly because FeenoX needs to know how many arguments these
functions take.
If either \f[CR]OFFSET\f[R] and/or \f[CR]SCALE\f[R] are given, the node
locations are first shifted and then scaled by the provided values.
When defining several meshes and solving a PDE problem, the mesh used as
the PDE domain is the one marked with \f[CR]MAIN\f[R].
If none of the meshes is explicitly marked as main, the first one is
used.
If \f[CR]UPDATE_EACH_STEP\f[R] is given, then the mesh data is re\-read
from the file at each time step.
Default is to read the mesh once, except if the file path changes with
time.
For each \f[CR]READ_FIELD\f[R] keyword, a point\-wise defined scalar
function of space named \f[CR]<function_name>\f[R] is defined and filled
with the scalar data named \f[CR]<name_in_mesh>\f[R] contained in the
mesh file.
The \f[CR]READ_FUNCTION\f[R] keyword is a shortcut when the scalar name
and the to\-be\-defined function are the same.
If no mesh is marked as \f[CR]MAIN\f[R], the first one is the main one.

The format is automatically detected from the extension, which should be
either \f[CR]msh\f[R] (version 2.2 ASCII) or \f[CR]vtk\f[R] (legacy

Otherwise, the keyword \f[CR]FILE_FORMAT\f[R] has to be given to set the
format explicitly.
If there are several meshes defined by \f[CR]READ_MESH\f[R], the mesh
used to write the data has be given explicitly with \f[CR]MESH\f[R].
If the \f[CR]NO_MESH\f[R] keyword is given, only the results are written
into the output file without any mesh data.
Depending on the output format, this can be used to avoid repeating data
and/or creating partial output files which can the be latter assembled
by post\-processing scripts.
When targeting the \f[CR].msh\f[R] output format, if
\f[CR]NO_PHYSICAL_NAMES\f[R] is given then the section that sets the

This might be needed in some cases to avoid name clashes when dealing

The output is node\-based by default.
This can be controlled with both the \f[CR]NODE\f[R] and \f[CR]CELL\f[R]
keywords.
All fields that come after a \f[CR]NODE\f[R] (\f[CR]CELL\f[R]) keyword
will be written at the node (cells).
These keywords can be used several times and mixed with fields.
For example
\f[CR]CELL k(x,y,z) NODE T sqrt(x\[ha]2+y\[ha]2) CELL 1+z\f[R] will
write the conductivity and the expression 1 + \f[I]z\f[R] as cell\-based
and the temperature \f[I]T\f[R](\f[I]x\f[R], \f[I]y\f[R], \f[I]z\f[R])
and the expression $\[rs]sqrt{x\[ha]2+y\[ha]2}$ as a node\-based fields.
If a printf\-like format specifier starting with \f[CR]%\f[R] is given,
that format is used for the fields that follow.
Make sure the format reads floating\-point data, i.e.\ do not use
\f[CR]%d\f[R].
Default is \f[CR]%g\f[R].
The data to be written has to be given as a list of fields,
i.e.\ distributions (such as \f[CR]k\f[R] or \f[CR]E\f[R]), functions of
space (such as \f[CR]T\f[R]) and/or expressions (such as
\f[CR]T(x,y,z)*sqrt(x\[ha]2+y\[ha]2+z\[ha]2)\f[R]).
Each field is written as a scalar, unless either the keywords
\f[CR]VECTOR\f[R] or \f[CR]SYMMETRIC_TENSOR\f[R] are given.
In the first case, the next three fields following the \f[CR]VECTOR\f[R]
keyword are taken as the vector elements.
In the latter, the next six fields following the
\f[CR]SYMMETRIC_TENSOR\f[R] keyword are taken as the tensor elements.

.SH SPECIAL VARIABLES
.SS \f[CR]done\f[R]
.PP
Flag that indicates whether the overall calculation is over.
.PP
This variable is set to true by FeenoX when the computation finished so
it can be checked in an \f[CR]IF\f[R] block to do something only in the
last step.
But this variable can also be set to true from the input file,
indicating that the current step should also be the last one.
For example, one can set \f[CR]end_time = infinite\f[R] and then finish
the computation at \f[I]t\f[R] = 10 by setting \f[CR]done = t > 10\f[R].
This \f[CR]done\f[R] variable can also come from (and sent to) other
sources, like a shared memory object for coupled calculations.
.SS \f[CR]done_static\f[R]

It is set to true (i.e.\  ≠ 0) by feenox if \f[CR]step_static\f[R] ≥

finished or not.
