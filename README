Capabilities

-   Both free as in “free speech” and in “free beer”
-   The problem to solve is defined through a syntactically-sugared
    self-descriptive English-like plain-text input file that should

    possible:
    -   no need to recompile if the problem changes (FeenoX is a
        program, not a library)
    -   nouns are definitions and verbs are instructions
    -   simple problems need simple inputs
    -   everything is an expression
    -   100%-defined user output (no PRINT nor WRITE_RESULTS
        instructions, no output)
-   Cloud-first design (cloud friendliness is not enough)
-   MPI parallelization
-   Leverages high-quality well-established free and open source
    libraries to solve…

        -   writes results in either Gmsh or VTK (Paraview) format
-   Focuses on flexibility, especially when defining non-uniform
    multi-solid material properties from ASME tables
-   Follows the Unix programming philosophy
    -   rule of separation
    -   rule of silence
    -   rule of economy

  ----------------------------- ----------------------------------------------

-   FeenoX is cloud-first. It was designed to run on servers.

-   Be aware that FeenoX does not have a GUI. Read the documentation,
    especially the description and the FAQs. Ask for help on the GitHub
    discussions page if you do now understand what this bullet means.

-   Debian/Ubuntu packages are unofficial, i.e. they are not available
    in apt repositories. They contain dynamically-linked binaries and
    their dependencies are hard-coded for each Debian/Ubuntu release.
    Make sure you get the right .deb for your release
    (i.e. bookworm/bullseye for Debian, kinetic/focal for Ubuntu).

-   Generic GNU/Linux binaries are provided as statically-linked
    executables for convenience. They do not support MUMPS nor MPI and
    have only basic optimization flags. Please compile from source for
    high-end applications. See detailed compilation instructions.

-   Try to avoid Windows as much as you can. The binaries are provided
    as transitional packages for people that for some reason still use
    such an outdated, anachronous, awful and invasive operating system.
    They are compiled with Cygwin and have no support whatsoever.
    Really, really, get rid of Windows ASAP.

      “It is really worth any amount of time and effort to get away from
      Windows if you are doing computational science.”

Git repository

To compile the Git repository, proceed as follows. This procedure does
need git and autoconf but new versions can be pulled and recompiled
easily. If something goes wrong and you get an error, do not hesitate to
ask in FeenoX’s discussion page.

1.  Install mandatory dependencies

        sudo apt-get update
        sudo apt-get install git build-essential make automake autoconf libgsl-dev

    If you cannot install libgsl-dev but still have git and the build
    toolchain, you can have the configure script to download and compile
    it for you. See point 4 below.

2.  Install optional dependencies (of course these are optional but
    recommended)

        sudo apt-get install libsundials-dev petsc-dev slepc-dev

3.  Clone Github repository

        git clone https://github.com/seamplex/feenox

4.  Bootstrap, configure, compile & make

        cd feenox
        ./autogen.sh
        ./configure
        make -j4

    If you cannot (or do not want to) use libgsl-dev from a package
    repository, call configure with --enable-download-gsl:

        ./configure --enable-download-gsl

    If you do not have Internet access, get the tarball manually, copy
    it to the same directory as configure and run again. See the
    detailed compilation instructions for an explanation.

5.  Run test suite (optional)

        make check

6.  Install the binary system wide (optional)

        sudo make install

To stay up to date, pull and then autogen, configure and make (and
optionally install):

    git pull
    ./autogen.sh; ./configure; make -j4
    sudo make install

See the download page and the compilation guide for detailed
information.

Licensing

FeenoX is distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public License
version 3 or (at your option) any later version. The following text was
borrowed from the Gmsh documentation. Replacing “Gmsh” with “FeenoX”
(using Unix’s sed) gives:

  FeenoX is “free software”; this means that everyone is free to use it
  and to redistribute it on a free basis. FeenoX is not in the public
  domain; it is copyrighted and there are restrictions on its
  distribution, but these restrictions are designed to permit everything
  that a good cooperating citizen would want to do. What is not allowed
  is to try to prevent others from further sharing any version of FeenoX
  that they might get from you.

  Specifically, we want to make sure that you have the right to give
  away copies of FeenoX, that you receive source code or else can get it
  if you want it, that you can change FeenoX or use pieces of FeenoX in
  new free programs, and that you know you can do these things.

  To make sure that everyone has such rights, we have to forbid you to
  deprive anyone else of these rights. For example, if you distribute
  copies of FeenoX, you must give the recipients all the rights that you
  have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
  code. And you must tell them their rights.

  Also, for our own protection, we must make certain that everyone finds
  out that there is no warranty for FeenoX. If FeenoX is modified by
  someone else and passed on, we want their recipients to know that what
  they have is not what we distributed, so that any problems introduced
  by others will not reflect on our reputation.

  The precise conditions of the license for FeenoX are found in the
  General Public License that accompanies the source code. Further
  information about this license is available from the GNU Project
  webpage http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl-faq.html.

FeenoX is licensed under the terms of the GNU General Public License
version 3 or, at the user convenience, any later version. This means
that users get the four essential freedoms:[1]

0.  The freedom to run the program as they wish, for any purpose.
1.  The freedom to study how the program works, and change it so it does
    their computing as they wish.
2.  The freedom to redistribute copies so they can help others.
3.  The freedom to distribute copies of their modified versions to
    others.

So a free program has to be open source, but it also has to explicitly
provide the four freedoms above both through the written license and
through appropriate mechanisms to get, modify, compile, run and document
these modifications using well-established and/or reasonable
straightforward procedures. That is why licensing FeenoX as GPLv3+ also
implies that the source code and all the scripts and makefiles needed to
compile and run it are available for anyone that requires it (i.e. it is
compiled with ./configure && make). Anyone wanting to modify the program
either to fix bugs, improve it or add new features is free to do so. And
if they do not know how to program, the have the freedom to hire a
programmer to do it without needing to ask permission to the original
authors. Even more, the documentation is released under the terms of the
Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License so
these new (or modified) features can be properly documented as well.

Nevertheless, since these original authors are the copyright holders,
they still can use it to either enforce or prevent further actions from
the users that receive FeenoX under the GPLv3+. In particular, the
license allows re-distribution of modified versions only if

a.  they are clearly marked as different from the original, and
b.  they are distributed under the same terms of the GPLv3+.

There are also some other subtle technicalities that need not be
discussed here such as

-   what constitutes a modified version (which cannot be redistributed
    under a different license)
-   what is an aggregate (in which each part be distributed under
    different licenses)
-   usage over a network and the possibility of using AGPL instead of
    GPL to further enforce freedom

These issues are already taken into account in the FeenoX licensing
scheme.

It should be noted that not only is FeenoX free and open source, but
also all of the libraries it depends on (and their dependencies) also
are. It can also be compiled using free and open source build tool
chains running over free and open source operating systems.

[1]  There are some examples of pieces of computational software which
are described as “open source” in which even the first of the four
freedoms is denied. The most iconic case is that of Android, whose
sources are readily available online but there is no straightforward way
of updating one’s mobile phone firmware with a customized version, not
to mention vendor and hardware lock ins and the possibility of bricking
devices if something unexpected happens. In the nuclear industry, it is
the case of a Monte Carlo particle-transport program that requests users
to sign an agreement about the objective of its usage before allowing
its execution. The software itself might be open source because the
source code is provided after signing the agreement, but it is not free
(as in freedom) at all.
